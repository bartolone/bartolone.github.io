title: Predicting Album Ratings via Album Name Metalness
---

Bands make linguistic choices when writing lyrics, naming songs and albums, and choosing the name of their band. Hopefully, these choices signal the band's aesthetics to potential listeners so that they find their audience.

I tend to have strong positive reactions to certain words that signify an aesthetic I am likely to enjoy (really, anything that sounds like Dungeons and Dragons, especially if there's a wizard involved). I got to wondering if good album names could actually help facilitate connections between bands and potential fans. But how to quantify the aesthetic?

Thankfully, Iain Barr has already created a "metalness index" for 10,000-some words based on their relative
frequency in metal lyrics compared to other forms of writing [(full details in his blog post here.)](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2016/Apr/20/heavy-metal-and-natural-language-processing-part-1/)

I used Iain's metalness index to create metalness scores for approximately 7,500 metal album titles as well as
for the song titles on each album and the name of each band, and then ran a series of linear regressions to
determine if metalness scores could predict the ratings that metal fans give to those albums.

...

No. Nuh-uh. Not even a little. (The "best" model using only metalness scores accounted for approximately
0.1% of the variance in album ratings.)

(I'd probably give a bonus point per wizard myself, but I seem to be in the minority.)

In other words, it doesn't seem to matter what you name your band, your album, or your songs, people are going to like your music (or not) based on less-obvious factors like, you know, if it's any good or not. So you may as well name your album The Committee Chairmanâ€™s Particularly Literary Secretary (the 4th, 9th, 1st, 16th, and 3rd-least metal words in the index).

Still, I learned a few things during my investigation into the album ratings on [metalstorm.net](metalstorm.net). For one, user ratings tended to be higher for albums released in earlier years:

However, that vertical line represents Metal Storm's founding in 2000 -- and if you look at the albums they reviewed retrospectively, they are nearly all classics by the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Iron Butterfly (that's right). Release year post-1999 didn't have nearly as much of a relationship to album ratings.

(If you're wondering about that low rating in the late '80s, that would be when a renowned extreme metal band named Celtic Frost tried to get some of that Bon Jovi money by recording a glam album. It ... did not work.)

The only other bit of album metadata that seemed related to review scores was the number of users reviewing an album:

It seems pretty self-evident that users would be more likely to review albums that were widely acclaimed, even if they themselves hated it.

(If you guessed that the two albums that hundreds of reviewers nearly universally hated were the album Metallica recorded with Lou Reed and their much-maligned St. Anger, [invisible oranges](http://theblekgoat.com/invisible-oranges-become-fully-visible/) to you.)

My [None-More-Black repo](https://github.com/bartolone/none-more-black) has more findings and code from my investigation of how metalness scores (don't) relate to album ratings. Stay tuned to that space for more heavy investigations.
